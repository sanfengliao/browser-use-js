## Overview

`browser-use-js` is a powerful library that combines browser automation capabilities with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent browser interactions. Built on top of Playwright and LangChain, it provides a seamless way to automate browser tasks with AI assistance.

This is a JavaScript/TypeScript port of the original [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) Python library.
